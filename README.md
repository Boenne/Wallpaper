# About

![alt tag](https://github.com/Boenne/Wallpaper/blob/master/readme_images/program.png)

You use the program by inserting a folder path of the folder you wish to load images from. 
Remember to check 'Include subfolders' box if you want to include subfolders. Once that is done click 'Start'.

When you've inserted a folder path and pressed 'Start' you can choose to bookmark the folder path by pressing the 'B' button.
To load images from a bookmarked path simply click on the bookmarked path in the list.

The 'Restart' button is used when the program is running and you add some new images to the folder path, 
then you click 'Restart' to load in the new images.

The 'S' button is to open the settings window. Where you can insert a base path of your images.

Then you only have to insert the individual folder names within the base path. 
So if you have a base path of 'C:/Images' that contains subfolders like 'Landscapes' and 'Cats', then you only have to insert 'Landscapes' and press 'Start'.

If the images in the folder path are in portrait mode the program will make a copy where the image is placed to the right,
and the left is then filled out with the top of the original image.

These new images are placed in a subfolder of the current folder called 'wallpaper_temps', which is deleted when closing the program.
